Hey, I am Xiang Yu! Welcome to my blog! (* 'ᵕ' )ｲ

{% hl_text danger %}I want to be a good front end developer who can speak three languages fluently {% endhl_text %}
( Mandarin, English and Japanese).

I love the indoors, outdoors, cats and doing things that challenge me in new ways.

My hobbies include learning languages, programming, the keyboard, painting and in general just finding fun things to do. XD

I will continuously update this blog to record what I have learned and experienced.

Thank you for taking the time to read it. Helpful suggestions are welcome!
